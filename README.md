# Introduction

This is a projected directly ported from [ndt_matching repository](https://github.com/atokuz/ndt_matching/tree/master) as I want to make sure that the code is ROS2-independent such that it can be easily integrated into my ROS2 project following the Open-Close principle. I also slightly adjust the file hierarhy and syntax arrangement to improve readability. I also replaced boost::shared_ptr to std::shared_ptr.
